# Image-and-Pattern-Recognition

The objective is to get basic knowledge about machine learning on images for real applications. The training will be done on two real applications of image and pattern recognition, by using the mathematical and computational tools.

In the first project, we will work on the classification method of logistic regression. We will :
1. Describe a set of images using a set of region descriptors.
2. Using the computed descriptors, we will simulate a classification experiment and compute some
performance measures from the results of the logistic regression classifier.
In this experiment, we will divide the dataset into two disjoint sets : learning and testing. There
are two separate Python scripts in this TP :
−extract features.py, in which the descriptors are extracted from the images and saved on the
hard disk.
−classify inserts.py, in which the classification experiment is performed with the aforementioned
dataset.

In the second  project, the objective is to propose several methods to classify skin lesions. Such a project would be very useful not only for dermatologists, who will make more accurate diagnoses and
therefore make better decisions, but also for general practitioners, who would refer patients to the specialist in a
more appropriate way.
